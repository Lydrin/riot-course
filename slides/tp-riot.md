## What is RIOT

<br><br>

RIOT is

- a real-time multithreaded operating system

- built with in-house networking capababilities

- designed for microcontroller based devices

- open-source: https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT

## History of the project

- 2008: Firekernel, micro-kernel for wireless sensor networks

- 2013: Inria & FU Berlin funded RIOT

- The community today:

  - Almost 180 contributors since the beginning

  - Academics: Inria, FU Berlin, HAW Hamburg, Berkeley, UCLA, MIT, TZI

  - Industrial: Thal√®s, Cisco, Samsung, ImgTec

  - SME: Zolertia, OTAKeys, Mesotic, Eisoc, We-sens

- Annual RIOT Summit: https://summit.riot-os.org

## The philosophy behind RIOT

- RIOT is free-software, licensed under LGPLv2.1

- The community takes inspiration from Linux

- Decisions and orientations are taken by a grass-root community

- Use standards whenever possible <br>
  (C-ANSI, standard tools, standard protocols, standard procedures)

- Avoid code duplication
